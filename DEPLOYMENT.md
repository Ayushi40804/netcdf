# ðŸš€ Streamlit Cloud Deployment Guide

## Quick Deployment Steps

### 1. Prepare Repository
âœ… **Already Done**: Your repository is ready at https://github.com/Ayushi40804/netcdf.git

### 2. Deploy to Streamlit Cloud

1. **Go to Streamlit Cloud**
   - Visit: https://share.streamlit.io/
   - Sign in with your GitHub account

2. **Create New App**
   - Click "New app"
   - Select repository: `Ayushi40804/netcdf`
   - Branch: `main`
   - Main file path: `chatbot.py`
   - App name: `argo-netcdf-processor` (or your preferred name)

3. **Configure Secrets**
   - In the deployment settings, add the following to "Secrets":
   ```toml
   [api_keys]
   google_api_key = "YOUR_GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY"
   ```

4. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy!"
   - Wait for deployment to complete (usually 2-5 minutes)

### 3. Configuration Files Ready

âœ… **Files created for deployment:**
- `requirements.txt` - All necessary dependencies
- `.streamlit/config.toml` - Streamlit configuration
- `.streamlit/secrets_template.toml` - Template for secrets
- `runtime.txt` - Python version specification
- `packages.txt` - System dependencies (if needed)

### 4. Important Notes

**API Key Setup:**
- You'll need to add your Google Gemini API key in the Streamlit Cloud secrets
- Don't commit the actual API key to the repository

**Database:**
- The app uses SQLite (file-based) so no external database setup needed
- Sample data is automatically created on first run

**Dependencies:**
- All required packages are listed in `requirements.txt`
- Streamlit Cloud will automatically install them

### 5. Troubleshooting

**If deployment fails:**
1. Check the logs in Streamlit Cloud dashboard
2. Verify all dependencies in `requirements.txt` are compatible
3. Ensure the API key is correctly set in secrets

**Common issues:**
- Memory limits: ChromaDB might need optimization for cloud deployment
- Package conflicts: Update package versions if needed

### 6. Post-Deployment

Once deployed:
1. Test the application with sample queries
2. Verify the database functionality
3. Share the public URL with your team

**Example queries to test:**
- "What is the average temperature for float 5904297?"
- "Show me all salinity measurements"
- "Find the deepest measurement in the database"
